# SwiftUI: Screen Time API Demo

A demo of using screen time apis (FamilyControls, ManagedSettings, and DeviceActivity) to implement a device activity monitor with custom UI and actions.

Specifically, this demo includes the following:
1. Apply restrictions (the shield view) to user-specified activities Immediately
2. Monitor Device Activities and apply restrictions based on a usage-time threshold within a specific schedule, for example, from 9 pm to 6 am.
3. Implement Custom Shield UI 
4. Implement Custom Shield Actions
